//Q20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers,
// countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing
// these items.
// Making a programming language array
let programmingLanguage = ["python", "typescript", "javascript", "java"];
// print the message of list
console.log("List of Programming Language");
// print the values of array in the form of list
programmingLanguage.forEach(language => console.log(language));
// //* if we dont use forEach method lets see 
//console.log(programmingLanguage); // the list is in array form
